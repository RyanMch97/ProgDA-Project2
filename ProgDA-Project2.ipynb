    "FNAs are a commonly used diagnostic test for breast cancer, in which a thin needle is used to withdraw a small sample of cells from a breast mass. The cells are then examined under a microscope by a pathologist to determine if the tumor is cancerous. The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset was created by extracting features from the images of FNA samples of breast masses, which were then used to classify the tumors as either benign or malignant.\n",
